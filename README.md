# Lingvolive Omnibox

This is a Chrome extension providing an Omnibox interface for the lingvolive.com dictionary service.

## How to use

Type the letter "l" in the address bar, then hit `SPACE` or `TAB` and start typing the word you want to translate. Suggestions with brief translations will appear below the address bar as you're typing. Hitting `ENTER` on the input will open the corresponding article on lingvolive.com. Hitting `Alt+ENTER` will pronounce the word (if the pronounciation is available, which is denoted by a little musical note next to the word).

You can choose the dictionaries to use on the options page.
